# Welcome to Milan — GitHub Pages (mobile-friendly)

This folder is ready to upload to a GitHub repository and publish with **GitHub Pages**.

## Publish in 60 seconds
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public is simplest).
2. Upload **all files and folders** from this ZIP into the repository root.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** (or master) / **root**
4. Wait for the published URL (it will look like `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO/`).

## PDF download
The download button points to:
`assets/welcome-to-milan.pdf`

To update the guide later, just replace that file with a new PDF (same name).

## Notes
- The page is optimized for smartphone viewing (QR scan).
- Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts (Inter + Playfair Display).
